## 🧠 About Me

Welcome to my profile!  
I'm a determined student with a big dream — to study **Computer Science** at universities like **Harvard**, **MIT**, or **Oxford**, and use technology to **transform the world**.

Currently based in **Uberlândia, Brazil**, I founded **Null Forge**, a project focused on **free programming education** for beginners. I believe that **code can change lives**, and I’m building my journey one project at a time.

💡 **Fun fact:** Repeating a school year pushed me to grow. Setbacks are fuel for comebacks. 🚀
