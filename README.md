## 📌 About This Repository

This repository hosts the **source code, materials, and documentation** behind **Null Forge** — a **free programming education initiative** created to empower beginners, especially underrepresented students in Brazil, with skills in **web development** and **computer science**.

Our mission: **"Teach, impact, and inspire."**

## 👨‍💻 Who I Am

My name is **Kauã Souza**, a high school student and aspiring Computer Scientist from **Uberlândia, Brazil**.

I’m currently:

- 🎓 A 2nd-year student at Dom Bosco High School  
- 💻 Learning **HTML, CSS, JS**, and diving into **Python & React**  
- ✝️ An active church volunteer  
- 📚 Taking **English** and **Math** courses outside of school  
- 🧠 Focused on growing **Null Forge** as a platform for impact

Despite having repeated a school year, I turned this challenge into motivation to aim higher — my ultimate goal is to study **Computer Science at Harvard**, **MIT**, or **Oxford**, and use tech as a tool to solve global problems.

## 🌟 Why I Built This

As a student in Brazil who dreams big, I’ve often felt the **gap in access** to high-quality tech education. Null Forge is my way of:

- Giving back to my community
- Creating opportunity where it often doesn’t exist
- Proving that you don’t need money to learn — just curiosity, internet, and a mentor

This project is **deeply personal**. It represents my belief that **education is the strongest code we can write to change the world.**

- 🧑‍🏫 Train other students to become mentors and educators
- 🌎 Expand the initiative across Brazil (and maybe beyond!)
- 🔗 Collaborate with international programs & universities
- 📚 Build a real-world portfolio to support my application to **Harvard** and similar institutions
